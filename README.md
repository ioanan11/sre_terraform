# Terraform

## What is Terraform

Terraform is an infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows you to build, change, and version infrastructure safely and efficiently. This includes low-level components such as compute instances, storage, and networking, as well as high-level components such as DNS entries, SaaS features, etc. Terraform can manage both existing service providers and custom in-house solutions.

## Why Terraform

## Setting up Terraform
- After you download Terraform from https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html, unzip the file and create an environment for it on your local machine.
